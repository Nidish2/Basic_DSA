/**
 * This class provides a classical implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm. The
 * graph data structure is encapsulated in a nested static class `Graph`,
 * separating the data representation from the algorithm logic.
 * 
 * Overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number
 * of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because the
 * algorithm consists of two depth-first searches (DFS) and a graph
 * transposition, each of which takes O(V + E) time.
 * 
 * overall space complexity is O(V + E) for storing the graph and its transpose,
 * as well as the visited array and stack used during the DFS traversals.
